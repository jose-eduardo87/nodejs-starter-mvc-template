# nodejs-starter-mvc-template

A MVC starter kit for your apps!

# Description

I built this application to create a template MVC app that I could use as the start point for development. A 'User' model is already configured, among with its controllers, all the logic needed
to authentication / authorization, and routes. I've also included basic CRUD operations regarding the User collection with some other handlers.

Feel free to use this template in your projects.
